# func-di

A functional, immutable, type safe and simple dependency injection library inspired by angular.

## Why func-di

- 0 dependency: extremely lightweight
- functional: no class and decorator
- immutable: stable dependency if you do not dynamically switch the whole ioc container
- type safe: good develop experience and static type checks

## Usage

See test cases.
